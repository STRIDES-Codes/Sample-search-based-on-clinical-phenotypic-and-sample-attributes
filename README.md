# NIH STRIDES-Codes/subject-sample-search



Welcome to NIH STRIDES-Codes/subject-sample-search.

This codeathon project will explore existing technologies to search subjects and sample data based clinical, phenotypic and other attributes of subjects and sampes. We hope to explore the GA4GH Discovery Search API, BigQuery and FHIR.

## GA4GH Search

[GA4GH Search](https://github.com/ga4gh-discovery/ga4gh-search) is a new API specification recently been submitted for approval. A reference implementation is available from DNAStack. Search provides the capability to make available data from multiple data technologies such as json, FHIR, Phenopackets and sql databases. 

Options for the codeathon might include

- Exploring and querying the existing data sources
- Adding data sources e.g. as BigQuery Tables
- Installing and running a GA4GH Server

## BigQuery

BiqQuery tables are made available by [SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/sra-bigquery-examples/) and by the [Institute for Systems Biology Cancer Genomics Cloud](https://isb-cancer-genomics-cloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sections/BigQuery.html).

These allow search of subject and sample data from projects with corresponding genomic data. Searches may be conducted via the Google Cloud Platform console, the BigQuery API, or be set up to be queried by the GA4GH Search reference server. 

## FHIR

The Kids First FHIR Server provides a [data dashboard](https://ncpi-api-fhir-service-dev.kidsfirstdrc.org/dashboard/) and [API endpoint](https://ncpi-api-fhir-service-dev.kidsfirstdrc.org/) to query data from the Kids First initiative. Queries allow links to GA4GH DRS ids to locate genomic data files.
